# Coffee Machine Project with Python
This Python project is a simple implementation of a coffee machine simulation. The program allows users to interact with a virtual coffee machine, choose different types of coffee, and manage the machine's resources.

# Features
Menu Options: Users can select from a menu of coffee options, including espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

Resource Management: The coffee machine manages resources such as water, milk, and coffee beans. It checks if there are enough resources to make the selected coffee.
